/* Problem Description
 *
 * Given the ages of n people, calculate how many people
 * are in a given age range. (You will need to do this many times).
 *
 * Input:
 *  0 < n < 10^8, the number of people.
 *  0 < q < 10^9, amount of queries to calculate amount of people in a range [min, max]
 *  q lines, with a pair of min and max age values, separated by blank:
 *    0 <= min_age <= 110
 *    min_age <= max_age <= 110
 *
 * Output:
 *  q lines with the amount of people in the given range.
 *
